	<h2>Grace Jung</h2>
	    <p>Hi, my name is Grace Jung, and I’m a current sophomore from Queens, NYC attending Stuyvesant High School. Besides leading GEM, some of my hobbies include watching K-Dramas, golfing, creating publications, and singing. I founded GEM with an aspiration to aid the elderly community. My life mentors, my grandparents, have shaped me into the person I am, and I am confident that the service older adults provide for youth could be reciprocated. I hope that GEM can evolve into an organization that can support the community that built me and many others from my foundations all throughout the world. I hope that you can join our journey and make our dreams become a reality.

	<h2>Hannah Moon</h2>  
	    <p>Hi! My name is Hannah Moon and I’m a current sophomore at Stuyvesant High School. I am Vice President of GEM. My passions include journalism, learning new languages, and exploring different cultures. I really enjoy spending time with family, watching shows, and listening to music. I’m currently watching Shameless and listening to J.Cole! Aside from GEM, I am involved with my school’s Red Cross and Life Lift Initiative, both of which include volunteering. I think that this passion for volunteering stemmed from my childhood, where I always took care of my younger sisters while my parents were working. These experiences have led me to gain an eagerness for helping others, which GEM aims to give to volunteers. I know that GEM serves a great purpose and will continue to make an impact, so I hope to contribute as much as I can in this growing community.

	<h2>David Yang</h2>
	    <p>Hello, my name is David Yang, currently a junior at Francis Lewis High School and the secretary of GEM. In addition to helping with duties within GEM, some of my hobbies include spending time at home, napping, spending time with my friends, and trying new ice cream flavors. My top picks are pistachio and rocky road! One of my favorite volunteer activities was definitely being a teacher’s assistant for my church. This has allowed me to discover my passion for guiding and supporting others in their personal journeys. I am grateful for the chance of joining GEM as the secretary, as it gives me an exciting opportunity to extend my impact in my community.

	<h2>Abigail Cho</h2>
	    <p>Hi! My name is Abigail Cho, and I am a sophomore attending Stuyvesant High School. My role in G.E.M is Operation Director. My hobbies include reading science magazines, learning new music on my clarinet, listening to music, writing short stories, and watching various dramas/movies (my favorite movie is The Lion King). Ever since my childhood, my grandmother has been by my side, babysitting me and providing me with love and comfort unable to be gained anywhere else. This inspired me to join G.E.M as I believe our seniors should receive the same comfort that they gave in their early years and our younger generation should be able to receive the same amount of love I felt when I was their age. In the future, I hope to use the lessons I learned from G.E.M. to help those in need, as I aspire to become a doctor.

	<h2>Dickson Jiang</h2>
	    <p>Hello, my name is Dickson Jiang, a sophomore at Stuyvesant High School and the Research Coordinator for GEM. Some hobbies I enjoy are playing sports, biking, and writing. In addition to spending time with my siblings, I love interacting with new people, and especially, older adults which has urged me to put my efforts into GEM. Alongside having only positive interactions with my grandparents who have supported my family immensely, even having a simple conversation with a senior created new heartwarming experiences that I would never forget. I believe that with continuous support, we can provide aid for seniors and create meaningful experiences for both parties.

	<h2>Seyoung Kim</h2>
	    <p> Hello! Don’t let my instagram username mislead you, my name is actually Seyoung Kim. I am currently a sophomore in Francis Lewis High School. I don’t like to go out much, but I enjoy spending time with my friends. I love music and watching philosophical shows, including Community and Breaking Bad. Joining this organization has taught me the importance of connecting with a different generation and bringing awareness to the hardships that the elderly may face. Through GEM, I hope to bring joy to the elderly.

	<h2>David Son</h2>
	    <p>Salutations! My name is David Son, and I am a sophomore at Stuyvesant High School. I am also the finance director for GEM. My favorite activities are sleeping, listening to music, making music, and playing games. I also love performing on stage or in the band pit for STC. My grandmother practically raised me from the day I was born until the age of 10 because my parents were constantly working.  I am extremely grateful for all of her love and support, and because of that, I joined GEM as a way of indirectly giving back to my grandmother. I hope that through GEM, I can honor my grandmother and support the elderly community just as she has supported me.

I enjoy spending time with my family and friends, skiing, snowboarding, playing the piano and more. I’m currently watching Ugly Betty, which I love!

	<h2>Angelina Weng</h2>
	    <p>Hi! I’m Angelina Weng, a current sophomore attending Stuyvesant High School. In my free time, I love spending time with loved ones, binging TV shows (I love cheesy romcoms), singing, and doing arts and crafts. I was raised by my grandparents while my parents were working away from home in a different state, so I am eternally grateful for everything they’ve done for me, my brother, and my cousins. I hope that we can make the elderly happier with our actions, and give back to them in the same way they’ve provided for us.
